# O___ni

1. If tree is not BST then make the BST 
2. Max sum of Array (Kadance Algo)
3. String Combination
4. Array 0's and 1's in linear time complexity
5. Difference between Hashtable & HashMap

#
- 2nd/nth highest salary from employee table
- Count of employee from each department
- Each department with highest salary

# 

- Time complexity of Arrays.sort() and which sorting is used.
- Max time complexity of HashMap -> O(logn)
- Combination of an string
- Rotate an array by k times O(n)
- ArrayList vs LinkedList 
- Can we insert hetrogenous element in ArrayList (like int,char,string at a time)
- Find longest substring from a string contains all the distinct character.
- Maximum sequence from an unsorted array `[9,34,6,17,16,8,7]` and here it is `4` because `[6,7,8,9]`
