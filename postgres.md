# INDEX

- An index is performance tuning method of allowing faster retrieval of records from the table. An index creates an entry for
  each value and it will be faster to retrieve data.

- While it (mostly) speeds up a `select`, it slows down `inserts`, `updates` and `delete` because the database engine does
  not have to write the data only, but the index, too. An index need space on hard disk (and much more important) in RAM
