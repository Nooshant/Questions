suppose we have given the developer in env integration involvement and q environment it and production environment
All are on the same server and and how we can I you can design architecture so you can differentiate between all this things.
suppose you have to configure like database configuration to one of these environment and it should not reflect to the other environment how you can achieve this one.
suppose you have the sun some of the configuration are same and some of the configuration and dynamic then how you can achieve this type of application.
